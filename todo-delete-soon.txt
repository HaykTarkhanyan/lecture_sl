* use itemize on pretty much all slides

* iterate language. short style

* optimize linebreaks. optimally one sentence/thought per line. 
(the above does not need to be OVERDONE)
no "hanging" word

* for common symbols extend latex math

* no "whitespace control mess". 
use the new layout macros. in general. 

* for vertical spacing nearly always use \vfill

* don't always change fontsize. usually this is not needed

* absolute prio: check plots if there any todos left / errors.
this must be resolved BEFORE friday

* I know that this is maybe less clear but:
delete outcommented UNNEEDED GARBAGE stuff. 
if in case of doubt a bit too much stays, this is fine.

* use good titles. the titles count in the text. they don't need to be repeated
they should optimally describe what happens on the slide.
also don't repeat the chunk name always in slide titles

* delete punctuation in formulas

* usually: do not indent stuff.
