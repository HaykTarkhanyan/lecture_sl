\begin{vbframe}{Componentwise gradient boosting}

GB (with trees), has strong predictive
performance but is difficult to interpret unless the base learners are stumps.

\lz

The aim of CWB is to find a model that:

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    has strong predictive performance,

  \item
    has components that are still interpretable,

  \item
    does automatic selection of components,

  \item
    is sparser than a model fitted with maximum-likelihood estimation.
\end{itemize}

\lz

This is achieved by using \enquote{nice} base learners which yield familiar
statistical models
in the end.

\lz

Because of this, CWB is also often referred to as \textbf{model-based boosting}.

\end{vbframe}

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{vbframe}{Base learners}

In classical gradient boosting only one kind of base learner $\mathcal{B}$ is used, e.g.,
regression trees.

\lz

For CWB we generalize this to multiple base learner sets $\{ \mathcal{B}_1, ... \mathcal{B}_J \}$ with associated parameter spaces
$\{ \bm{\Theta}_1, ... \bm{\Theta}_J \}$,
% $$
%   % b_j^{[m]}(\xv,\pmb\theta^{[m]}) \quad j = 1,\dots, J\,,
%   \{ \bmm_j(\xv, \thetam): j = 1, 2, \dots, J \},
% $$
%
 where $j \in \{ 1, 2, \dots, J \}$ indexes the type of base learner.
%
\lz

Again, in each iteration, only the best base learner
% $\bmm_{\hat{j}}(\xv, \thetam)$
is selected and updated.

\framebreak

Common examples of base learners are

\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}

\end{minipage}

\vspace{\baselineskip}

More advanced base learners could also be  Markov random fields, random effects, or trees.

\end{vbframe}

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{vbframe}{Additive model structure}
\begin{footnotesize}
We restrict these base learners to additive models, i.e., having a base learner $ b_j(\xv, \thetab^{[1]})$ and another base learner $b_j$ of the same type but with a different parameter vector $\thetab^{[2]}$, then it is possible to combine them to a new base learner of the same type:

$$
 b_j(\xv, \thetab^{[1]}) + b_j(\xv, \thetab^{[2]}) =
 b_j(\xv, \thetab^{[1]} + \thetab^{[2]}).
$$
\vspace*{0.1cm}

Thus, if $\{ b_j(\xv, \thetab^{[1]}), b_j(\xv, \thetab^{[2]}) \} \in \mathcal{B}_j$, then $b_j(\xv, \thetab^{[1]} + \thetab^{[2]}) \in \mathcal{B}_j$.
\lz

Often base learners are not defined on the entire feature vector $\xv$ but on
a single feature $x_j$:

$$
  b_j(x_j, \theta) \quad \text{for } j = 1, 2, \dots, p.
$$

This directly incorporates a variable selection mechanism into the fitting
process, since in each iteration only the best base learner is selected in
combination with the associated feature, and each base learner can be
(substantially) more complex than a stump (e.g., univariate linear effects or
splines).

\begin{vbframe}{handling of categorical features}

Suppose a feature $x \in \{1, \dots, G\}$.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Two common options for encoding categorical features for CWB in a base learner $b$ are:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item 
        One base learner to simultaneously estimate all classes: 
        $$b(x) = \sum_{g=1}^G \theta_g\mathds{1}_{\{g = x\}} = \thetab^T (\mathds{1}_{\{x = 1\}}, ..., \mathds{1}_{\{x = G\}})^T$$
        Hence, $b$ incorporates a one-hot encoded feature with group means $\thetab\in\R^G$ as estimates. 
    
    \item 
        One binary base learner per class:
        $$b_g(x) = \theta_g\mathds{1}_{\{g = x\}}$$  
        Including all classes of the feature means adding $G$ base learners $b_1, \dots, b_G$ with each accounting for one specific class.
  \end{itemize}
  \item The \texttt{compboost} package currently implements the first variant.
\end{itemize}

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\framebreak

Advantages within CWB of simultaneously handling all classes: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item 
        Much faster estimation process compared to adding the classes as individual binary base learners.

    \item 
        Explicit solution of optimizing $\thetabh = \argmin_{\thetab\in\R^G}\sumin (\yi - b(\xi))^2$ with:
        $$\thetabh = (\thetah_1, \dots, \thetah_G)^T,\ \thetah_g = n_g^{-1}\sumin \yi \mathds{1}_{\{\xi = g\}}$$

    \item 
        Adding regularization is easy to add by reframing the base learner as a linear model and using, e.g., Ridge regression for estimating $\thetabh$.  
\end{itemize}

Disadvantage within CWB of simultaneously handling all classes: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item 
        If class $g^\ast\in\{1, \dots, G\}$ is not informative, the respective parameter estimate $\thetah_{g^\ast}$ is (almost sure) not $0$.
\end{itemize}

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\framebreak

Advantages within CWB of including classes individually: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item 
        A finer selection within the feature is possible since non-informative classes are simply not included in the model and hence have an effect of $0$.

    \item 
        Explicit solution of $\thetah_g = \argmin_{\thetab\in\R^G}\sumin (\yi - b_g(\xi))^2$ with:
        $$\thetah_g = n_g^{-1}\sumin \yi \mathds{1}_{\{\xi = g\}}$$
\end{itemize}

Disadvantage within CWB of simultaneously handling all classes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 
        Fitting CWB is much slower due to the overhead in each iteration (updating the model, pseudo residuals, and doing the base learner selection) after conducting one tiny step into the direction of the 1-dim parameter $\thetah_g$.

    \item 
        The base learner has exactly one degree of freedom which makes penalization and a fair selection very hard if not impossible.
\end{itemize}

\end{vbframe}

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{vbframe}{intercept handling}

\begin{itemize}
  \item CWB is initialized with a loss-optimal constant $\fm[0](\xv)$ as initial model intercept.
  \item An intercept is often referred to as part of a model which contains information independent of the features.
  \item Suppose linear base learners $b_j(\xv) = \theta_{j1} + \theta_{j2} x_j$ with data independent intercept $\theta_{j1}$ and slope $\theta_{j2}$.
  \item Adding base learner $\hat{b}_j$ in the first iteration with parameter estimates $\thetamh[1] = (\hat{\theta}_{j1}^{[1]}, \hat{\theta}_{j1}^{[1]})$ consequently updates the intercept to $\fm[0](\xv) + \hat{\theta}_{j1}^{[1]}$.
  \item Throughout the fitting process, the intercept is adjusted $M$ times to its final form:
    $$
    \fm[0](\xv) + \sum\limits_{m=1}^M \hat{\theta}^{[m]}_{j^{[m]}1}
    $$
\end{itemize}

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\framebreak

Two possible options to handle the intercept in CWB are:

\begin{itemize}

\item Include an intercept base learner:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Add base learner $b_{\text{int}} = \theta$ as potential candidate considered in each iteration.
    \item At the same time, remove the intercept from all linear base learners to only use $b_j(\xv) = \theta_j x_j$.
    \item The final intercept is given by $\fm[0](\xv) + \hat{\theta}$.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Include an intercept in each linear base learner $b_j(\xv) = \theta_{j1} + \theta_{j2} x_j$ and accumulate all intercepts to one global intercept after the fitting.

\end{itemize}
